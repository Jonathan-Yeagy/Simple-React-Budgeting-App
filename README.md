This class project is a simple budgeting app that allows users to set a budget, add & remove items they've purchased,
and calculate how much of their budget they have remaining.

**Entrypoint:** /src/App.js

Run `npm install` in project directory, then run `npm start` to launch the app.

## Context

This project was made in 2019 as a class assignment to demonstrate a competency in React with the following goals:

I developed this project through the second half of the semester.
